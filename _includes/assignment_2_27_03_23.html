        <h3> Analyzing Larceny and Theft Incidents in Crimes in San Francisco city </h3>
        <h2> n this article, we have discussed the San Francisco crime data and how it can be accessed and used by researchers, journalists, and policymakers to better understand crime trends and patterns in the city. 
            As part of our analysis, we plotted three graphs that highlight important information about the dataset.</h2>

        We decided to conduct a detailed analysis of Larceny and Theft incidents, as they are the most common crimes, accounting for 22.5% of all reported crimes. 
        Additionally, the most frequent resolution for these crimes is through arrests. To analyze these incidents, we filtered out the ones with a resolution of "NONE" and focused on those with descriptions such as 'ARREST, BOOKED' or 'ARREST, CITED'. 
        We also created a breakdown by PdDistrict to determine which districts are performing better in addressing these crimes..<br><br>
        Upon analyzing the data, we noticed that the proportions of Larceny and Theft incidents have remained relatively stable over time. 
        This leads us to believe that the police department's efforts to address these crimes have not significantly impacted the overall incidence of these crimes. <br><br>

            In conclusion, by utilizing the map, and analyzing the concentration of crime in different police districts,
        
            we have obtained valuable insights that can help identify patterns and trends in the data. This can aid in making recommendations
             to improve public safety in San Francisco and enable the Police to gain a better understanding of crime trends in the city. <br><br>

          <br>  The dataset used for this analysis is the San Francisco Crime Data from May 2017 to May 2018.
           The goal of this data story is to analyze the patterns of larceny and theft incidents in the city and identify any trends or changes over time.<br> 
           
           The first visualization is a time-series bar chart showing the monthly counts of larceny and theft incidents. The chart reveals a clear pattern of seasonality,
            with higher counts during the summer months and lower counts during the winter months. The highest counts of incidents occurred in August and September,
             while the lowest counts occurred in December and January. Overall, the chart shows that larceny and theft incidents were more common during the warmer months of the year.
